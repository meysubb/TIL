I've started to focus on moving away from sourcetree and github desktop, GUI interfaces for git.
Just going to use this as my personal reference for git commands. I'm tired of searching for Stack overflow links.


### Basic commands

```bash
git status
git pull
```

Git status will list all new files and modified files already under version control.

General structure for committing and pushing changes up to the origin branch.

```bash
git add [filename]
git commit -m "enter message"
git push
```

Branches

```bash
git branch
git checkout branch_name
```

The first one lists all branches in the repo, and the second command will move you to a specific branch in which work can be done.

Creating new branches

```bash
git checkout -b [name_of_branch]
git push origin [name_of_branch]
```

The first command creates a new branch locally, and the second will create an upstream copy of this branch.

### Correcting Mistakes

Sometimes mistakes happen and I look to correct them. A fine example of this is reversing a commit.

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD^
git reset --hard HEAD^ 
```

Use soft, if you want to keep the local changes. Use hard, if you don't want to keep local changes either.
